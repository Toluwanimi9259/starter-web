Next, right click on the folder, and click on "Map network drive". Choose a drive letter, for mine, I'm going to choose J:. Go thorough the rest of the wizard and just keep clicking next.

In DOSBox, when it first starts, type the following

mount J J:\POS
mount C C:\POS
Assuming that you mapped your network drive to J, and that your local file system is located on drive C, and that POS on that system is located in C:\POS. Modify this to suit your needs.
Then, type "C:" into DOSBox
Type "POSCONFG.exe"

It will take you to the POS Configuration screen. Note that it is posCONFG, not POSConfig. I made this mistake a few times.

Under network, set the path to "J:\POS" assuming that you mapped your network drive to J.

Save, then press F1 to exit. Press 3 to start the POS program.

After all that work, POS should finally work over a network. If it's not working, you probably screwed something up. In which case, don't be afraid to ask for help. Don't try to "Fix" it and end up screwing it up even more.

That is all,
There it is,
